		<h1>This page is a review of the joint venture between Subaru and Toyota!</h1>
		<p>Thats right, i'm talking about the Brz, Frs and Gt86! This is truly an amazing vehicle, under sold by those who have yet to drive it. Most of which caused by something as miniscule as the spec' sheet, which in most other vehicles is more than enough to go by. Once most see the car has only 200hp and 160ftq most stop reading and assume that its just to slow to be fun however, the contrary is true! As you read on you would see the very light footprint of just under 2800lbs and near perfect weight distrubution. Im not a salesmen by any means all I can do is show you why most who drive, consider buying!</p>

		<h1>Interior</h1>
		<p>The interior,though basic, is nicely styled. Keepin cost down only including such comforts as a cheesy, aftermarket looking sterio,lack of arm rests and almost useless back seat. All that gets easily tossed aside once n the heavily bolstered leather/alcentera (Brz limited), nicely placed stearing wheel, smooth gearbox and surprisingly spacey truck storage. </p>
		
		<h1>Why its current stock state really doesnt matter?</h1>
		<p>Basically, any short comings there might have been can be fixed with aftermarket equipment. Thats part of the joy of this car, it was simply designed to be molded to your liking. Which, to me, is everything! If power is the only downfall nay sayers can point out, then theres great news. Power adders range from exhausts to forced induction, with multiple options in every department. Even a wide range of body kits for those just interested in appearence.</p>

		<h1>Track Testing</h1>
		<p>No, this car wont set any records at the Neurenburg ring and it certanly isnt going to impress anyone at the local drag strip. The great thing about this car goes back to its balance, in that you can have this car at 10/10ths during track day. that still may not set any records, however the-in-the seat experince is something those in mustangs and comaros will soon start to envy. Simply because while they use there power to pass on the straight aways theyll see thats only a small portion of the fun. They will see you come into a turn with confidence that you and your machine are truly one, as you let the tail of the car slide out with controle that of a ball room dancer! Jeremy Clarkson said that you dont measure this car in power, its measured in smiles.</p>
